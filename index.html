        <h1>Sean, Iron Man</h1>
        <p>Well, here he is!<br>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist,<br>inventor, a founding member of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)">Avengers</a>and the former CEO of Stark Industries, a company originally started by his father, Howard Stark.<br>
        <p>Anyway, in a lot of ways I do find myself conceptualizing the whole idea of his existence.<br>
        I look at myself and what do I see,<br>a hardworking soul with a chiseled outer-core,<br>that whenever danger lurks it is the Ironman that my foes have to endure<br>
        Moreover, I also need a Pepper Potts by my side!! LOL!</p>
